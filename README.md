# Top-Poker-Hand

**This webapp uses the Deck of Cards API to get a hand of 5 playing cards, and determines the highest ranking poker hand using the getTopRankingHand function**

## Running instructions:

- Install React, npm, create-react-app, and axios if not previously installed
- Create a new react app using create-react-app
- Open the App.js file and Copy and paste the code from the App.js file in this repo, or Download the file and replace the App.js file
- cd into the react directory on your terminal
- Enter "npm start"
- Click on the button that says click me! in the browser on localhost:3000
- Scroll to see tests and the last line will be the output using the data from Deck of Cards

## Assumptions
- I assumed a HIGHCARD to be above a 10
- Anything 10 or below will return NOTHING
